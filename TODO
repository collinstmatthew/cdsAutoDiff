add in start date as a number
  -- first for cashflows
  -- then for accrual
  -- then for dates

getting nan for prices something going wrong in the getFHB function look through the log

transform everything from doubles to actual dates

generate schedules from tenors and termination date

implement the date count conventions propely with dates

allow the curve to evolve along proper time and not just dummy time

allow hazard rates to either move with time or stay constant.
