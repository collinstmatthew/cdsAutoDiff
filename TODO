because the vector field is rendered each time it has no concept of scale between images and thus will also resize to make them the same size I expect!

Another assumption is not stub period and first coupon isn't always paid

splitting up the times into dummy times and what not create two separte plotEvolution functions for now and then make them better after everything is working
